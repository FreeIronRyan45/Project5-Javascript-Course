So, this project covers the classic rock, paper, scissors game that every kid play back then. 

Rock, paper, scissors is a classic two-player game where each player chooses rock, paper, or scissors. Items are compared and whichever player choose the most powerful item wins in three different outcomes.
1. Rock destroys scissors, 2. Scissors cuts paper, or 3. Paper covers rock, or in rare cases, 4. If there's a tie, then the game ends in a draw. So, the code I wrote breaks the game into 4 parts:
1. Getting the user's choice, 2. Getting the computer's choice, 3. Compare the two choices and determine winner and 4. Start the program and display the results.
